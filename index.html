<p>JavaScript is an important and popular programming language used alongside CSS, and HTML.
Over 97% of websites use JavaScript. Use of JavaScript can be diverse such as:
 <li>Client-side JavaScript</li>
 <li>Server-side JavaScript</li>
</p>

 JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). 
 JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.
 JS is a zero-index language.

 <p>Simple Examples:
  <li>Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let or const keywords.
    <pre>
	 <code>
	  x=10;
	  y=10;
	  z=x+y;
	 </code>
	 <code>
	  x=87;
	  y=1;
	  z=x+y;
	 </code>
	 <code>
	  x=9;
	  y=10;
	  z=x+y;
	 </code>
	 <code>
	  x=12;
	  y=15;
	  z=x+y;
	 </code>
	 <code>
	  x=8;
	  y=9;
	  z=x+y;
	 </code>
	</pre>
  </li>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>Save the document by pressing  <kbd>Ctrl + S </kbd></li>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>Save the text by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + C </kbd></li>
  </p>
  <p>
   <li>Message from computer: <samp> File not found.<br> Press F1 to continue. </samp></li>
   </p>
  <p>
   <li>Defining text as variables: <br>
   The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</li>
  </p>

<p>
JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. 
Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. 
Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. 
Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.
There are subsets of general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).
Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.

  <li>Java:
    <p>
	 A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language).
	 The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. 
	 Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. 
	 Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.
	 </p>
  </li>
  <li>JSON:
    <p>
	JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.
	</p>
	</li>
  <li>Web Assembly:
    <p>
	Since 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance-critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed.
	WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.
